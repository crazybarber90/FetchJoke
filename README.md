This task involves creating a component that fetches a random joke from the Chuck Norris API and allows the user to select a category from a dropdown menu to filter jokes. It also handles error states and loading states appropriately. The component uses useState and useEffect hooks in React for managing state and fetching data. Additionally, TypeScript is used to enforce type safety for state variables like the selected category, joke data, and categories list.
